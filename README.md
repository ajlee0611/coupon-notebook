#Analysis of Coupon Acceptance Based

### Summary of Findings

The first part of the notebook details several scenarios in which we find the ratio of acceptance of the coupons for bars based on various factors like type of passenger, number of monthly bar visits, and the age of the observant. In these exercises, there are several important conclusions that we can make. First, being an observant that makes at least
one visit to a bar per month greatly increases the chance that the observant will accept a bar coupon, quite intuitively. However, looking at the other factors like type of passenger is also important. Not having a kid present as a passenger in the vehicle when receiving the coupon is another strong indicator that someone will accept the coupon. 
Additionally, those who are under 30 are also much more likely to accept the coupon. We can conclude that these are important contributing factors to the rate of acceptance for bar coupons.

The second part of the notebook analyzes coffee house coupons in a similar fashion. Nevertheless, the findings are not the same. Upon analyzing the age distribution of those with at least one monthly coffee house visit, it seems that the data is slightly right skewed, meaning there is a higher concentration of younger people. As a result, I wanted to 
see if there could be a difference in the acceptance rate between younger and older people as there was in the bar coupon analysis. However, I found that the acceptance rate actually tends to be very similar across all age groups. Those under 35 do have a slightly higher percentage accepting the coupon compared to those over 35, but nothing substantial
enough to label this factor as conclusive.
